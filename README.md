# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

# Debugging Duplicate Goals

**Issue:** Users can add duplicate fitness goals.
**Debugging Task:** Prevent users from adding the same goal more than once.

# Solution
- The function checks if the goal being added in the input field already exists in the list before adding it.
- If duplicate fitness goals are found, an alert to inform the user shows and the goal is not added to the list.
- If it's not a duplicate fitness goal, the goal is added to the list.

# Challenges
- I found it challenging to put my thoughts together when I started. I had a lot of ideas of how I wanted to solve the problem and it became overwhelming.
- Time managment: I was missing an element which caused my code to not work and I couldn't figure it out, which led to me spending a lot of time trying to find the solution.

# What did I learn?
- Patience: You need to keep calm and patient when debugging. The more stressed you are, the less likely you are to find the solution.It is all in the details.
